\subsection{More Things}

Recall that the prefix `an-' is just a modified form of the prefix `a-'. The form `an-' is used when the following base begins with a vowel, or the letter `h.' Many Greek prefixes that end with a vowel have alternative forms to use before bases that begin with vowels or the letter `h.' Usually, this involves dropping off the final vowel of the prefix. This process is known as \textbf{elision}.
