\subsection{Prefixes}

Remember, the prefix is added to the front of the base. It modifies or adds extra information about the base, telling us how, where, or to what degree something happens.

    \caption{Prefixes for the body.}
    \hline 
    Prefix & Meaning & Example(s) \\ \hline
    ambi-, ambo- & `both' & ambidextrous \\
