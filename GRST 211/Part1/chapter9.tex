The term `neck' is applied to many body parts that have a constricted or narrowed portion. The base CERVIC- may indicate the neck of the uterus, bladder, or tooth, as well as the area between the head and the torso. TRACHEL- also has some ambiguity as it may be used about the neck of the uterus as well as the area between the head and torso (rarely the bladder or tooth).
